ICE 05: Websockets
In this activity, you will work in groups to build a simple websockets application

Instructions
Divide yourselves into groups of 3 - 5 students. Make sure to register all your group members on Canvas so that you get credit.

Implement the basic websockets setup demo from the sockets guide. Make sure that is up and running correctly before proceeding to the next step.

Using the demo as a starting point, create a simple networked web application. Make sure the application can handle everybody in your group. Be creative, but manage your time and expectations wisely so that you have a complete application to submit by the end of class.

Write up a README file that includes the names of all of your group members and a description of what the application does. Be sure to list anything a user might need to know before using your application. Also describe any challenges your group faced.

Submit your final assignment by initiating a pull request against this repo. You are welcome to deploy this project on a hosting service, but focus on getting something that works on your local machines.

NOTE: The demo uses Svelte, but you are welcome to switch to a different UI framework if you prefer.
