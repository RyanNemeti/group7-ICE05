The purpose of our application is to provide an interactive canvas, where you are able to click on the screen and create a shape of your choice.
You are also able to change the color of said shape via color wheel in the top left.  Setting up the project was our
biggest obstacle, and the only thing that users will need to know is that it isn't a blank screen, but a canvas
you can interact with.
